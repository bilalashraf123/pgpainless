About
-----

PGPainless aims to make using OpenPGP in Java projects as simple as possible.
It does so by introducing an intuitive Builder structure, which allows easy 
setup of encryption / decryption operations, as well as straight forward key generation.

PGPainless is based around the Bouncycastle java library and can be used on Android down to API level 9.

## Philosophy

* Prefer enums over magic constants

  When a method takes an integer constant as argument, it is not clear to the user where to source possible values from.
  An enum on the other hand only allows for a limited range of possible values and it is immediately clear to the user which values these are.
  
* Prefer builder methods over dependency injection

  While dependency injection has its place in software development, the user is often overwhelmed with methods
  that take dozens of arguments. It may not be obvious to the user what those arguments are used for.
  Instead the user should be guided by the API with builder classes and methods that make it clear what the parameters use is.
  Additionally sensible defaults should be provided as shortcuts.

### NOTE: PGPainless is in an early state of development. There may be dragons!

## Include PGPainless in your Project

PGPainless is available on maven central. In order to include it in your project, just add the 
maven central repository and add PGPainless as a dependency.

```gradle
repositories {
	mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
	implementation 'org.pgpainless:pgpainless-core:0.1.0'
}
```

## How to use PGPainless

The entry point to the API is the `PGPainless` class. Here you can find methods for a quick start :)

### Generate Keys

The first thing you probably want to do is generate you some nice tasty Key Pairs. The most straight forward way to do so is by calling

```java
        PGPSecretKeyRing keyRing = PGPainless.generateKeyRing()
                .simpleRsaKeyRing("Juliet <juliet@montague.lit>", RsaLength._4096);
```

but feel free to explore the API further. PGPainless allows you to create Key Pairs consisting of a master key plus several sub keys, even with different algorithms at the same time!
Take for example a look at this delicious key:

```java
        PGPSecretKeyRing keyRing = PGPainless.generateKeyRing()
                .withSubKey(
                        KeySpec.getBuilder(ECDSA.fromCurve(EllipticCurve._P256))
                        .withKeyFlags(KeyFlag.SIGN_DATA)
                        .withDetailedConfiguration()
                        .withDefaultSymmetricAlgorithms()
                        .withDefaultHashAlgorithms()
                        .withPreferredCompressionAlgorithms(CompressionAlgorithm.ZLIB)
                        .withFeature(Feature.MODIFICATION_DETECTION)
                        .done())
                .withSubKey(
                        KeySpec.getBuilder(ECDH.fromCurve(EllipticCurve._P256))
                        .withKeyFlags(KeyFlag.ENCRYPT_COMMS, KeyFlag.ENCRYPT_STORAGE)
                        .withDefaultAlgorithms())
                .withMasterKey(
                        KeySpec.getBuilder(RSA.withLength(RsaLength._8192))
                                .withKeyFlags(KeyFlag.SIGN_DATA, KeyFlag.CERTIFY_OTHER)
                                .withDefaultAlgorithms())
                .withPrimaryUserId("Juliet <juliet@montague.lit>")
                .withPassphrase("romeo_oh_Romeo<3")
                .build();
```

### Encrypt / Sign Data

Encrypting and signing data is pretty straight forward as well.
```java
        EncryptionStream encryptor = PGPainless.createEncryptor()
                .onOutputStream(targetOuputStream)
                .toRecipients(publicKeyRings)
                .usingSecureAlgorithms()
                .signWith(secretKeyDecryptor, signingKeyRing)
                .noArmor();
```

Note: Despite the name, the `EncryptionStream` can be used to sign only as well. Simply replace the `.toRecipients()` option with `doNotEncrypt()`.

The resulting `EncryptionStream` can then be used to encrypt data like follows:

```java
        Streams.pipeAll(sourceInputStream, encryptor);
        sourceInputStream.close();
        encryptor.close();
```

The encrypted data will be written to the provided `targetOutputStream`.

Additionally you can get information about the encrypted data by calling

```java
        OpenPgpMetadata result = encryptor.getResult();
```

This object will contain information like to which keys the message is encrypted, which keys were used for signing and so on.

### Decrypt / Verify Encrypted Data

To process incoming encrypted / signed data, just do the following:

```java
        DecryptionStream decryptor = PGPainless.createDecryptor()
                .onInputStream(sourceInputStream) // insert encrypted data here
                .decryptWith(secretKeyDecryptor, secretKey)
                .verifyWith(trustedKeyIds, senderKeys)
                .ignoreMissingPublicKeys()
                .build();
```

Again, the resulting `DecryptionStream` can be used like a normal stream.

```java
        Streams.pipeAll(decryptor, targetOutputStream);
        decryptor.close();
```

*After* the `DecryptionStream` was closed, you can get metadata about the processed data by retrieving the `OpenPgpMetadata`.
Again, this object will contain information about how the message was encrypted, who signed it and so on.

```java
        OpenPgpMetadata result = decryptor.getResult();
```

## About
PGPainless is a by-product of my [Summer of Code 2018 project](https://blog.jabberhead.tk/summer-of-code-2018/).
For that project I was in need of a simple to use OpenPGP library.

Originally I was going to use [Bouncy-GPG](https://github.com/neuhalje/bouncy-gpg) for my project,
but ultimately I decided to create my own OpenPGP library which better fits my needs.

However, PGPainless is heavily influenced by Bouncy-GPG.
